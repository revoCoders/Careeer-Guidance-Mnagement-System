Problem Abstract which results in this project proposal: The lack of preparation to navigate the changing work place can be tied specifically to lack of career knowledge and awareness. More than half high school students say no one in their schools has been helpful in advising on career options to further their education. Without structured guidance activities young people tend to drift through their high school education without gaining knowledge of all the career opportunities available to them or skills that are required. While conseling structure designed to help students gain career awareness are in place within the educational system the field of school based guidance and counseling is itself confronted with great challenges that make it more difficult to provide students with strong career guidance. Hence We are proposing the Career Guidance Management System with intervention of Android app (Android) with web application ( HTML CSS Javascript and PHP) and vitality database architecture(MySQL). As a group we need to assure that the system will help in the opportunities identification and embrace the by the students after school or during through personal development from the provision of the system.
